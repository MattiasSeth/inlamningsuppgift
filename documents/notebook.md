Read through the assignment and wrote down some notes, also took a quick glance at the problem background and cliques links.
Made an assignment repository on GitHub and downloaded GitHub Desktop on my laptop so I can use both my computers if I want to. 
Downloaded the datafile and created a couple smaller test files with 1000-50000 lines. Looked at the assignment again and decided I will start with edges problem tomorrow.

Made a shell script to look how many overlaps were below 1000 in the test files. All my test files gave the same result so I decided to make some larger test files. I ran some more test and noticed that the original file gave the same result as a file one sixth it size.

Continued with the shell script, had some minor problems with the test files and lack of knowledge on shell commands. I got the script to count the numbers of edges with a sufficiently large overlap in the test files but not on the original file. Decided not bother with the larger file now and instead look at the node degree distribution problem.
