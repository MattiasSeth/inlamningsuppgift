Read through the assignment and wrote down some notes, also took a quick glance at the problem background and cliques links.
Made an assignment repository on GitHub and downloaded GitHub Desktop on my laptop so I can use both my computers if I want to. 
Downloaded the datafile and created a couple smaller test files with 1000-50000 lines. Looked at the assignment again and decided I will start with edges problem tomorrow.
